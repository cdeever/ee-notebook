# Devices

Devices are self-contained products or modules with defined external interfaces — things that come in enclosures or on breakout boards, have connectors, and are documented as units. At this level, reasoning concerns capabilities, operating modes, interface compatibility, and integration constraints rather than internal circuit details. A development board is evaluated by its peripherals, connectors, and software support, not by the individual ICs on the PCB. A wireless module is evaluated by its protocol support, range, power consumption, and host interface, not by its RF front-end topology.

These are the purchased building blocks that get integrated into larger designs. An MCU dev board, a sensor breakout, a motor, a display — each one is a self-contained device that becomes a component in a system. The entries here reflect devices encountered during bench learning and project work: development platforms, interface adapters, communication modules, actuators, and power sources. Production devices (phones, appliances, vehicles) operate at this same level but aren't cataloged here because the notebook focuses on learning and building.

## Compute and Communication Modules

**Wireless module.** A purchased module combining an RF transceiver (and often an MCU) into a single unit with an antenna connection and a host interface. Examples include ESP32 (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + MCU), LoRa modules (long-range, low-data-rate), and nRF24L01 (2.4 GHz short-range). Key parameters are protocol, frequency band, range, data rate, power consumption, host interface (SPI, UART), and antenna type (PCB, U.FL, SMA). Appears in IoT, remote sensing, and wireless control projects. Composes from RF front end, baseband processor, and sometimes an integrated MCU. Antenna selection and placement have an outsized effect on real-world range — a module rated for 1 km in line-of-sight may get 50 m indoors with a poorly placed PCB antenna.

**GPS/GNSS module.** A purchased module that receives satellite signals and outputs position, velocity, and time data over a serial interface. Common examples are u-blox NEO series modules. Key parameters are constellation support (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou), position accuracy, time-to-first-fix (cold start vs. hot start), update rate, and power consumption. Appears in tracking, navigation, and time-synchronization projects. Composes from RF front end, correlator, navigation processor, and serial output interface. Needs a clear view of the sky — indoor use or poor antenna placement causes long fix times or no fix at all. The serial output (typically NMEA sentences) is easy to parse but arrives at relatively low update rates (1–10 Hz for most consumer modules).

**Display module.** A purchased display with an integrated controller, connected to a host MCU via a standard interface. Common types are character LCDs (HD44780-compatible, parallel or I2C backpack), small OLEDs (SSD1306, I2C or SPI), and TFT panels (SPI or parallel). Key parameters are resolution, size, interface type, refresh rate, viewing angle, and power consumption. Appears in any project that needs visual output. Composes from the display panel, controller IC, and interface circuitry. The choice between I2C and SPI matters for update speed — I2C is simpler (two wires) but slower, while SPI can drive faster refresh rates for graphics-heavy displays. Power consumption varies dramatically by display technology: an OLED showing mostly black pixels draws far less than one displaying white.

**Camera module.** A purchased module containing an image sensor, lens, and interface circuitry. Common examples are OV2640 and OV5640 modules with DVP (parallel) or SPI interfaces. Key parameters are resolution, frame rate, interface type, lens field of view, and power consumption. Appears in machine vision, image capture, and surveillance projects. Composes from the image sensor, lens assembly, clock circuitry, and data interface. These modules generate substantial data throughput — even a modest 2 MP sensor at 15 fps produces data rates that can overwhelm a small MCU's memory and bus bandwidth. Most practical designs either process frames on a capable SoC (ESP32-CAM, Raspberry Pi) or capture single frames rather than continuous video.

## Actuators

**DC motor / servo.** A purchased electromechanical device that converts electrical energy into rotational motion. A bare DC motor spins when voltage is applied; a servo packages a DC motor with a gearbox, position sensor, and control circuit into a unit that accepts a PWM position command. Key parameters for DC motors are operating voltage, no-load speed, stall torque, and stall current. Key parameters for servos are torque, speed (time per 60 degrees), pulse width range, and voltage. Appears in robotics, automation, and mechanical projects. Composes from windings, magnets, brushes (or electronic commutation for brushless), and for servos, a gear train and feedback potentiometer. Stall current is typically several times the running current — the motor driver and power supply must handle the stall case, or the motor must be prevented from stalling.

**Stepper motor.** A purchased motor that moves in discrete angular steps, allowing precise open-loop position control. Key parameters are step angle (commonly 1.8 degrees = 200 steps/revolution), rated current per phase, holding torque, and detent torque. Appears in CNC, 3D printing, and precision positioning. Composes from multiple stator phase windings and a toothed rotor. Driven by a stepper driver (A4988, DRV8825, TMC2209) that handles the current-chopping and microstepping. Stepper motors lose torque at higher speeds due to the inductance of the windings limiting current rise time — the torque-speed curve in the datasheet is essential for determining whether the motor can handle the required load at the required speed.

## Interface

**USB-to-serial adapter.** A device that bridges between a USB host port and a TTL-level or RS-232 UART, providing a virtual COM port. Key parameters are supported baud rates, voltage levels (3.3 V or 5 V TTL, or RS-232), driver support, and flow control capability. Appears in embedded development, debug, and instrument communication. Composes from a USB-to-UART bridge IC (FTDI, CP2102, CH340), USB connector, and level-shifting circuitry. The most-used device on many embedded benches. Driver issues (especially on macOS and Linux with cheap CH340 clones) remain a common frustration.

**Logic level converter module.** A bidirectional level shifter on a small breakout board, typically MOSFET-based, for connecting circuits at different logic voltages (e.g., 3.3 V to 5 V). Key parameters are voltage range on each side, number of channels, directionality (bidirectional or unidirectional), and maximum speed. Appears in embedded prototyping wherever mixed-voltage systems need to communicate. Composes from level-shifting MOSFETs and pull-up resistors. Speed is the common limitation — cheap MOSFET-based bidirectional shifters work for I2C at 100–400 kHz but may not handle fast SPI clocks cleanly.

## Power

**AC-DC power supply (external).** A wall adapter or enclosed supply that converts mains AC to a regulated DC output. Key parameters are output voltage, current rating, efficiency, ripple, safety certifications, and connector type. Appears in every bench and product application that runs from mains power. Composes from EMI filter, rectifier, switching converter, isolation transformer, and output regulation subsystems. The safety certifications (UL, CE) are the most important specs for anything connected to mains — building a mains-connected supply from scratch requires knowledge of isolation, creepage/clearance distances, and safety standards.

**Battery pack / holder.** A mechanical and electrical assembly that holds one or more cells and provides connection to the circuit. Key parameters are chemistry, cell count/configuration (series/parallel), capacity, voltage range, and protection (built-in BMS or external). Appears in portable and field-deployed applications. Composes from cells, mechanical holder or spot-welded connections, and sometimes an integrated protection circuit. The distinction between a battery holder (mechanical, passive) and a battery pack (cells plus protection BMS) matters for safety — unprotected lithium cells require external protection circuitry.

## Development and Evaluation

**MCU development board.** A PCB built around a microcontroller, providing power regulation, programming/debug interface, pin headers, and typically USB connectivity. Key parameters are the MCU family, available peripherals (ADC, timers, communication interfaces), I/O count, development environment support, and onboard features (LEDs, buttons, sensors). Appears in embedded development and prototyping. Composes from the MCU, power regulation, debug interface (SWD/JTAG), clock source, and connector subsystems. The dev board is a device for learning and prototyping; in production, the MCU gets designed into a custom board with only the needed peripherals.

**FPGA development board.** A PCB built around an FPGA, providing power, configuration interface, clock sources, I/O headers, and often memory (SRAM, DDR) and communication interfaces. Key parameters are FPGA family and size (logic cells, block RAM, DSP slices), I/O standard support, onboard peripherals, and toolchain compatibility. Appears in digital design, signal processing, and hardware prototyping. Composes from the FPGA, power sequencing, configuration flash, clock distribution, and I/O subsystems. FPGA dev boards often require careful power sequencing — the board handles this internally, but understanding the sequence matters when debugging startup issues.

**Sensor module / breakout board.** A small PCB carrying a sensor IC plus minimal support circuitry (decoupling, pull-ups, voltage regulation), with pin headers for easy prototyping. Key parameters are the sensor type and specs, communication interface (I2C, SPI, analog), supply voltage range, and pinout. Appears in embedded prototyping and data acquisition. Composes from the sensor IC, decoupling, and sometimes a level shifter or regulator. Convenient for prototyping, but the module's layout and grounding may not match what a production design needs — performance measured on a breakout board may not transfer directly to a custom PCB.

## Tips

- GPS modules need a clear view of the sky — indoor use or poor antenna placement causes long fix times or no fix at all.

## Caveats

- The line between a device and a subsystem depends on perspective. A power supply module soldered onto a larger board might be treated as a subsystem in that context and a device when evaluated standalone.
- "Device" in this catalog means a purchased module or product integrated into a build, not a formal product category. The emphasis is on building blocks a learner uses to construct larger systems.
- Device specs often assume specific operating conditions (ambient temperature, load, input voltage). Real-world performance degrades at the edges of those conditions, and the derating curves in the datasheet (if they exist) are the guide to how much.
