# Subsystems

Subsystems are collections of blocks that together perform a higher-level function with defined performance specifications. A linear regulator. A buck converter. An ADC front end. A UART interface. At this level, reasoning shifts from transfer functions and bias points to specifications: regulation accuracy, conversion efficiency, data rate, error rate, and operating temperature range. The subsystem promises to deliver something measurable, and the question is whether it keeps that promise under the conditions the rest of the design imposes on it.

Subsystems are where domain specificity begins to matter more heavily. A buck converter belongs squarely in the power domain, while a UART is a communication construct. Cross-cutting subsystems exist — a reset supervisor touches both power and digital — but most entries at this level carry a clear domain affiliation. The boundaries of a subsystem are contractual: what it requires from its inputs, what it promises at its outputs, and what operating conditions it assumes.

## Power

**Linear regulator.** Drops an input voltage to a lower, regulated output voltage by dissipating the excess as heat. Key parameters are dropout voltage, output accuracy, line/load regulation, PSRR, quiescent current, and thermal limits. Appears in power domains across all applications. Composes from a voltage reference, error amplifier, pass element (block-level pieces), and output/input capacitors; appears inside device power trees and post-switching-regulator filtering stages. Simplicity and low noise are the strengths; efficiency (limited to Vout/Vin) is the weakness. A 12 V to 3.3 V linear regulator wastes 72% of input power as heat — a fact that surprises many beginners.

**Buck converter.** Steps down voltage using high-frequency switching, an inductor, and a control loop to achieve high efficiency. Key parameters are input/output voltage range, efficiency, output ripple, transient response, switching frequency, and EMI signature. Appears in every application that needs efficient voltage conversion. Composes from a controller/driver IC, MOSFETs (or integrated switches), an inductor, feedback network, and input/output capacitors; appears inside multi-rail power trees and battery-powered devices. The layout is as critical as the schematic — poor layout creates ground bounce, radiated EMI, and instability.

**Boost converter.** Steps up voltage using switching, an inductor, and a diode (or synchronous MOSFET). Key parameters are input/output voltage range, efficiency, output ripple, and current limits. Appears in battery-powered systems (boosting a single-cell Li-ion to 5 V), LED driving, and bias supply generation. Composes from similar blocks to a buck converter but with different topology; appears inside portable devices and LED backlight drivers. Input current is higher than output current (power conservation), which sometimes surprises when sizing input capacitors and traces.

**Charge pump.** Voltage conversion (doubling, inverting, or fractional) using only capacitors and switches, with no inductor. Key parameters are output voltage, output current capability (typically low), ripple, and efficiency. Appears in low-power applications and anywhere inductors are undesirable (cost, size, EMI). Composes from switch arrays and flying capacitors; appears inside RS-232 level shifters, small negative bias supplies, and LED drivers. Output current capability is fundamentally limited — charge pumps are for milliamps, not amps.

**Power sequencer.** Ensures that multiple voltage rails come up (and sometimes go down) in a specified order and timing. Key parameters are number of rails, sequencing delay, voltage monitoring thresholds, and fault response. Appears in multi-rail digital systems (FPGAs, SoCs) where incorrect power sequencing can cause latch-up or damage. Composes from voltage supervisors, delay circuits, and enable-signal routing; appears inside complex device power architectures. The datasheet's "recommended power-up sequence" section is the primary input to this subsystem's design.

**Battery management.** Monitors and controls battery charging, discharging, cell balancing (for multi-cell packs), and protection (over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, over-temperature). Key parameters are chemistry support (Li-ion, LiFePO4, lead-acid), cell count, charge algorithm, and protection thresholds. Appears in portable and battery-powered devices. Composes from charge controller ICs, voltage/current monitoring, protection MOSFETs, and balance circuits; appears inside battery-powered devices from phones to power tools. Getting the charge termination wrong for lithium chemistries is a safety issue, not just a performance issue.

## Signal Acquisition

**ADC front end.** The signal conditioning chain between a sensor or signal source and an analog-to-digital converter: anti-alias filter, buffer amplifier, level shifting, and sometimes a sample-and-hold. Key parameters are bandwidth, input impedance, noise floor, THD, and settling time. Appears in measurement, data acquisition, and audio domains. Composes from active filters, amplifier stages, and reference circuits; appears inside data loggers, instruments, and audio interfaces. The anti-alias filter must be designed for the ADC's actual sample rate — aliased noise is indistinguishable from signal once digitized.

**DAC output stage.** The signal conditioning after a digital-to-analog converter: reconstruction filter, buffer amplifier, and sometimes a voltage-to-current converter. Key parameters are output impedance, settling time, glitch energy, and output range. Appears in audio, waveform generation, and control domains. Composes from active filters, amplifier stages, and sometimes current-mode output circuits; appears inside audio outputs, signal generators, and control actuator drives.

**Sensor interface.** The signal chain from a raw sensor element to a usable signal: excitation (for resistive bridges or RTDs), amplification, linearization, and sometimes digitization. Key parameters depend on the sensor type but generally include sensitivity, offset, linearity, noise, and response time. Appears in measurement, industrial, and IoT domains. Composes from excitation sources, instrumentation amplifiers, and ADC front ends; appears inside environmental monitors, industrial process sensors, and medical instruments. Each sensor type has its own interface gotchas — thermocouples need cold-junction compensation, strain gauges need bridge excitation stability, and capacitive sensors need shielded drive.

**PLL (phase-locked loop).** A feedback system that locks an output oscillator's phase and frequency to a reference signal, enabling frequency synthesis, clock multiplication, and jitter reduction. Key parameters are lock range, lock time, phase noise, loop bandwidth, and spurious output levels. Appears in communication, RF, digital clocking, and audio domains. Composes from a phase detector, loop filter, and voltage-controlled oscillator; appears inside clock generators, frequency synthesizers, and FM demodulators. The loop bandwidth is the fundamental design trade-off — wider bandwidth tracks the reference faster but passes more reference noise to the output.

## Communication

**UART/serial.** An asynchronous serial communication interface that transmits data one bit at a time with start/stop framing, no clock signal. Key parameters are baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, and voltage levels (TTL, RS-232, RS-485). Appears in embedded, debug, and legacy communication. Composes from shift registers, baud rate generators, and level translators; appears inside microcontroller debug ports, GPS modules, and industrial serial links. The absence of a shared clock means both ends must agree on baud rate within a few percent — clock mismatch is the most common cause of garbled serial data.

**SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).** A synchronous serial bus with separate clock, data-in, data-out, and chip-select lines. Key parameters are clock frequency, clock polarity/phase (CPOL/CPHA), and data width. Appears in embedded systems for high-speed peripheral communication. Composes from shift registers and chip-select logic; appears inside ADC/DAC interfaces, flash memory access, and display drivers. The four possible clock mode combinations (modes 0–3) are a constant source of confusion — mismatching the mode produces garbage data that looks almost valid.

**I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit).** A synchronous serial bus using two wires (SDA, SCL) with multi-device addressing and acknowledgment. Key parameters are clock speed (100 kHz standard, 400 kHz fast, 1 MHz fast-mode plus), address space (7 or 10 bits), and bus capacitance limit. Appears in embedded systems for sensor, EEPROM, and peripheral communication. Composes from open-drain drivers, pull-up resistors, and address decoding; appears inside sensor clusters, configuration interfaces, and board management buses. Bus capacitance is the practical limit on device count and speed — long traces and many devices slow the rising edges below the spec.

**USB interface.** A differential serial communication standard with defined device classes, enumeration, power delivery, and hot-plug support. Key parameters are speed (Low/Full/High/Super), power capability, connector type, and protocol class (CDC, HID, MSC, etc.). Appears in every domain that connects to a computer. Composes from a PHY, protocol engine (usually in silicon), ESD protection, and connector; appears inside development boards, instruments, and data acquisition devices. USB implementation is mostly handled by silicon — the subsystem-level concern is choosing the right device class, handling enumeration correctly, and managing the power negotiation.

## Motor and Actuator

**Motor driver.** A subsystem that converts a control signal (PWM, step/direction, or analog) into the power drive needed by a motor. Key parameters are voltage and current rating, supported motor types (DC, BLDC, stepper), control interface, and protection features (overcurrent, thermal shutdown). Appears in robotics, automation, and embedded actuator control. Composes from H-bridges, gate drivers, current sensing, and control logic; appears inside CNC controllers, robot joints, and fan control systems. The current sense feedback path is critical for torque control and stall detection.

**Stepper driver.** A specialized motor driver for stepper motors, providing current-regulated microstepping drive. Key parameters are current per phase, microstep resolution, step rate, and decay mode (fast, slow, mixed). Appears in CNC, 3D printing, and precision positioning. Composes from H-bridges with current feedback, sequencing logic, and a DAC (for microstepping current levels); appears inside CNC controllers and positioning systems. Microstepping improves smoothness but does not improve positioning accuracy proportionally — mechanical resonance and load-dependent torque drop-off dominate at fine microstep levels.

## Protection and Supervision

**Reset/supervisor.** Monitors supply voltage and asserts a reset signal when the supply is below a threshold, ensuring the microcontroller or digital system doesn't operate on an unstable supply. Key parameters are threshold voltage, reset delay, active-low or active-high output, and watchdog timeout (if integrated). Appears in every embedded system. Composes from a voltage comparator, reference, and delay circuit; appears inside microcontroller power domains. The brown-out scenario — supply briefly dipping and recovering — is what makes supervisors necessary; without one, the processor may execute random instructions as the supply crosses the minimum operating voltage.

**OVP/OCP protection (over-voltage/over-current).** Monitoring and shutdown circuits that disconnect or clamp the supply if voltage or current exceeds safe limits. Key parameters are trip threshold, response time, and recovery mode (auto-retry, latch-off, or foldback). Appears in power and safety domains. Composes from comparators, voltage references, and disconnect switches (MOSFETs or fuses); appears inside power supply outputs, battery systems, and USB power delivery. The choice between latch-off and auto-retry depends on the failure scenario — latching is safer for protecting hardware, but auto-retry is preferred when transient overloads are expected and the system should recover automatically.

## Audio

**Audio amplifier.** A power amplifier subsystem that drives a speaker or headphone from a line-level signal. Key parameters are output power, THD+N, efficiency (Class A, AB, D), supply voltage range, and output impedance matching. Appears in audio and consumer electronics domains. Composes from a gain stage, output stage (push-pull, bridge-tied-load, or Class D switching), feedback network, and output filter (for Class D); appears inside audio playback devices and active speaker systems. Class D amplifiers dominate modern designs for efficiency, but the output filter and EMI management add complexity that Class AB avoids.

## RF

**Receiver front end.** The signal chain from antenna to baseband: band-pass filter, LNA (low-noise amplifier), mixer, and IF or baseband filter. Key parameters are frequency range, noise figure, sensitivity, selectivity, and dynamic range. Appears in RF and communication domains. Composes from filters, LNA stages, mixers, and local oscillator/PLL; appears inside radios, SDR receivers, and wireless communication modules. The noise figure of the first stage (LNA) dominates the entire receiver's sensitivity — Friis' formula shows that subsequent stages contribute decreasingly to total noise figure.

**Transmitter output stage.** The signal chain from baseband to antenna: upconversion (mixer), driver amplifier, power amplifier, output filter, and impedance matching network. Key parameters are output power, efficiency, linearity, spurious emissions, and harmonic suppression. Appears in RF and communication domains. Composes from mixers, amplifier stages, filters, and matching networks; appears inside transmitters, transceivers, and RF test equipment. Impedance matching at the antenna port is critical — a mismatch reflects power back into the PA, reducing efficiency and potentially damaging the output transistor.

## Digital

**Clock distribution.** A subsystem that takes a single clock source and distributes it to multiple destinations with controlled skew, jitter, and fanout. Key parameters are output frequency, jitter (period and phase), skew between outputs, and output format (LVCMOS, LVDS, LVPECL). Appears in digital, FPGA, and high-speed communication domains. Composes from clock buffers, PLLs, and transmission-line routing; appears inside FPGA boards, multi-processor systems, and high-speed ADC/DAC clock networks. At high frequencies, the PCB traces are part of the clock distribution — trace length matching and impedance control matter as much as the buffer IC.

## Tips

- Integrated subsystem ICs (like a complete buck converter with internal MOSFETs, or a USB-to-serial bridge) compress many block-level decisions into silicon. The datasheet application circuit is the starting point, not a suggestion — deviating from it requires understanding which internal assumptions are being violated.

## Caveats

- "Subsystem" in this context means a functional unit within a larger design, not a standalone product. A buck converter module purchased as a finished product is a device; a buck converter designed as part of a board's power tree is a subsystem.
- Communication subsystems (UART, SPI, I2C) are often implemented entirely in silicon inside a microcontroller. The subsystem-level reasoning still applies — baud rates, bus loading, protocol modes — even when there's no discrete circuit to inspect.
