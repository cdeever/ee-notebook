# Passive Components

Deceptively simple parts. Resistors, capacitors, and inductors look straightforward in a schematic — two terminals, one symbol, one equation. In practice, every passive has parasitic behavior that matters in some context, and knowing when to care about it is half the battle.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Resistors]({{< relref "resistors" >}})** — Ideal vs. real, tolerance and tempco, noise, and series/parallel beyond the textbook.
- **[Capacitors]({{< relref "capacitors" >}})** — Dielectric types, ESR, leakage, frequency behavior, and why 10 uF isn't always 10 uF.
- **[Inductors]({{< relref "inductors" >}})** — Stored energy, saturation, and why inductors misbehave when you least expect it.
