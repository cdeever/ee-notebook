# Units, Notation & Measurement

Keeping math, simulation, and reality aligned. Unit mistakes and notation confusion cause real hardware damage. This section covers the conventions and gotchas that sit between the equations and the bench.

## What This Section Covers

- **[SI Units & Prefixes]({{< relref "si-units-prefixes" >}})** — The scaled forms, prefix mistakes that kill hardware, and keeping conversions straight.
- **[Notation & Schematics]({{< relref "notation-schematics" >}})** — Reference designators, polarity and direction conventions, and reading other people's schematics.
- **[Measurement Basics]({{< relref "measurement-basics" >}})** — What the multimeter actually tells you, burden voltage, probe loading, and when to question your instruments.
