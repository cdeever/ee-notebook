# Laws & First Principles

The non-negotiable rules. These are the constraints that every circuit obeys regardless of topology, frequency, or how clever the designer thinks they are. When something doesn't add up at the bench, it's almost always because I'm misapplying one of these — not because the law is wrong.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Ohm's Law]({{< relref "ohms-law" >}})** — V=IR, when it applies, when it doesn't, and the practical meaning of impedance.
- **[Kirchhoff's Laws]({{< relref "kirchhoffs-laws" >}})** — KCL and KVL. Reference directions, sign conventions, and why these never fail.
- **[Conservation of Energy]({{< relref "conservation-of-energy" >}})** — Where power goes, heat as the universal sink, and accounting for "missing" power.
