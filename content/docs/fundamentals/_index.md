# Fundamentals

Nature's rules and universal constraints — the physics layer that everything else is built on. Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, power and energy, passive component behavior, circuit analysis techniques, and the unit system that ties it all together.

All of it seems simple until it needs to be applied to a real circuit on the bench. Analog and digital design are human-engineered behavior layered on top of these rules. When something doesn't add up, the answer is almost always here.

## Sections

- **[Laws & First Principles]({{< relref "laws-first-principles" >}})** — The non-negotiable rules: Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, conservation of energy.

- **[Signaling Models]({{< relref "signaling-models" >}})** — What is the signal and what is it measured against? Go & return paths, reference planes, single-ended vs differential, balanced vs unbalanced, and common-mode rejection.

- **[Power, Energy & Heat]({{< relref "power-energy-heat" >}})** — Where theory gets physical: power calculations, energy storage, and thermal limits.

- **[Passive Components]({{< relref "passive-components" >}})** — Resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers beyond the ideal models.

- **[Magnetics in Practice]({{< relref "magnetics-in-practice" >}})** — Inductors and transformers beyond the ideal: saturation, losses, parasitics, noise, inrush, and what to look for on the bench.

- **[Electromechanical Devices]({{< relref "electromechanical-devices" >}})** — Components where electrical signals create physical motion or sound: relays, reed switches, contactors, speakers, and buzzers.

- **[Semiconductors]({{< relref "semiconductors" >}})** — Diodes, BJTs, MOSFETs, and thyristors: the behavioral primitives that make active circuits possible.

- **[Circuit Analysis Techniques]({{< relref "circuit-analysis" >}})** — Series/parallel, voltage dividers, node/loop analysis, and Thevenin/Norton equivalents.

- **[Units, Notation & Measurement]({{< relref "units-notation-measurement" >}})** — SI prefixes, schematic conventions, and what instruments actually report.
