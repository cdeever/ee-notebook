# Fundamentals

The building blocks everything else rests on: Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, power and energy calculations, passive component behavior, basic circuit analysis techniques, and the unit system that ties it all together.

Entries here cover the concepts I keep coming back to — the stuff that seems simple until you actually need to apply it to a real circuit on the bench.

## Sections

- **[Laws & First Principles]({{< relref "laws-first-principles" >}})** — The non-negotiable rules: Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, conservation of energy.
- **[Power, Energy & Heat]({{< relref "power-energy-heat" >}})** — Where theory gets physical: power calculations, energy storage, and thermal limits.
- **[Passive Components]({{< relref "passive-components" >}})** — Resistors, capacitors, and inductors beyond the ideal models.
- **[Circuit Analysis Techniques]({{< relref "circuit-analysis" >}})** — Series/parallel, voltage dividers, node/loop analysis, and Thevenin/Norton equivalents.
- **[Units, Notation & Measurement]({{< relref "units-notation-measurement" >}})** — SI prefixes, schematic conventions, and what instruments actually tell you.
