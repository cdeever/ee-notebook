# Circuit Analysis Techniques

Turning schematics into understanding. These techniques are how you go from "I see a schematic" to "I know what this node voltage should be." They're the analytical backbone for debugging, design review, and making sense of someone else's circuit.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Series & Parallel Analysis]({{< relref "series-and-parallel" >}})** — Equivalent R/C/L, and when simplification helps vs. hides problems.
- **[Voltage Dividers & Loading]({{< relref "voltage-dividers-and-loading" >}})** — The most-used circuit pattern, loading effects, and input/output impedance.
- **[Node & Loop Analysis]({{< relref "node-and-loop-analysis" >}})** — Choosing references, writing useful equations, and sanity-checking results.
- **[Thevenin & Norton Equivalents]({{< relref "thevenin-norton" >}})** — Reducing complexity, bench usefulness, and limits of abstraction.
