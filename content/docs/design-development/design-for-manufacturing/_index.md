# Design for Manufacturing & Longevity

Thinking beyond the bench.

A design that works on the bench isn't finished — it needs to be buildable, testable, and maintainable at whatever scale is required. Design for Manufacturing (DFM) is the discipline of ensuring that a design can be produced reliably and cost-effectively. Design for longevity extends this thinking to the full product lifecycle: maintenance, repair, and eventual end-of-life.

DFM concerns apply even to one-off projects. A board that's impossible to hand-assemble wastes your own time. A design with no test access makes your own debugging harder. The principles here scale from personal projects to production runs, and thinking about them early prevents painful rework later.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Manufacturability Basics]({{< relref "manufacturability-basics" >}})** — Designing to remove obstacles between your files and a finished, working board.
- **[Assembly Yield]({{< relref "assembly-yield" >}})** — Understanding why units fail after assembly and how design choices influence the pass rate.
- **[Cost-Reduction Passes]({{< relref "cost-reduction-passes" >}})** — Systematically reducing cost without sacrificing reliability or testability.
- **[Serviceability]({{< relref "serviceability" >}})** — Designing products that can be diagnosed, repaired, and maintained in the field.
- **[Documentation Handoff]({{< relref "documentation-handoff" >}})** — Producing a complete package so someone else can build, test, and maintain the design.
- **[End-of-Life Planning]({{< relref "end-of-life-planning" >}})** — Anticipating component obsolescence, product transitions, and the end of the line.
