# Part Selection & Sourcing

Where design meets supply chain.

Selecting the right components is a design activity, not a purchasing activity. Every part choice involves tradeoffs between performance, availability, cost, package, and long-term supply. A beautiful circuit design is worthless if the key part is out of stock, obsolete, or only available with a 52-week lead time.

The supply chain disruptions of the early 2020s made every electronics designer painfully aware that part selection is a strategic decision. This subsection covers the practical realities of choosing components that exist, can be sourced, and will continue to be available for the life of the product.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Availability vs Ideal Specs]({{< relref "availability-vs-ideal-specs" >}})** — Starting with what you can actually buy, not what looks perfect on paper.
- **[Lifecycle Status: Active, NRND & EOL]({{< relref "lifecycle-status" >}})** — Understanding where a component sits in its lifecycle and what that means for your design.
- **[Second-Source Strategies]({{< relref "second-source-strategies" >}})** — Reducing supply chain risk by designing in alternatives from the start.
- **[Parametric Search Pitfalls]({{< relref "parametric-search-pitfalls" >}})** — Navigating distributor search tools without being misled by incomplete or simplified data.
- **[Distributor Realities]({{< relref "distributor-realities" >}})** — Understanding the practical landscape of authorized distributors, brokers, and sourcing channels.
- **[Designing for Substitution]({{< relref "designing-for-substitution" >}})** — Building flexibility into the circuit and layout so parts can be changed without a board respin.
