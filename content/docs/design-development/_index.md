# Design & Development

From concept to working hardware.

Design and development covers the process of turning ideas into real, working systems — from early concept and requirements, through schematic and layout, into part sourcing, prototyping, validation, and iteration. This section captures the decisions, tradeoffs, and workflows that sit between theory and reality.

Design does not happen in isolation. It is shaped by component availability, physical constraints, manufacturability, testability, and long-term maintenance. Choices made early echo forward into debugging, repair, and production. The focus here is practical design thinking — not just how to build circuits, but how to build systems that survive contact with the real world.
