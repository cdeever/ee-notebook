# Prototyping & Bring-Up

First contact with reality.

A prototype is the first physical test of a design — and it almost never works exactly as expected. This subsection covers strategies for getting from schematic to working hardware as quickly and safely as possible, and for extracting maximum learning from the first build.

Bring-up is where theory meets practice. Power rails may not come up cleanly, oscillators may not start, and connectors may not fit. Having a systematic approach to first power-on and initial testing prevents damage and produces useful data even when things don't work.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Prototype Strategies: Fast vs Faithful]({{< relref "prototype-strategies" >}})** — Choosing the right prototype approach based on what you need to learn.
- **[Assembly Options]({{< relref "assembly-options" >}})** — Selecting assembly methods that match your batch size, component mix, and turnaround needs.
- **[Bring-Up Checklists]({{< relref "bring-up-checklists" >}})** — Systematic first-power-on procedures that prevent damage and capture useful data.
- **[Power-First Validation]({{< relref "power-first-validation" >}})** — Verifying every supply rail before testing any functionality.
- **[Safe Smoke Testing]({{< relref "safe-smoke-testing" >}})** — Applying power for the first time without releasing the magic smoke.
- **[Capturing Early Lessons]({{< relref "capturing-early-lessons" >}})** — Recording what the first prototype teaches so the next revision benefits.
