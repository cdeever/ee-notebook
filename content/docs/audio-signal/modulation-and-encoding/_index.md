# Modulation & Encoding

Reshaping signals to carry information. Modulation impresses information onto a carrier — shifting it in frequency, varying its amplitude, or encoding it as a pulse pattern. These techniques show up everywhere from AM radio to Class-D amplifiers to digital audio interfaces.

The boundary between "audio/signal processing" and "communications" is thin here. AM and FM are covered in this section from a signal-processing perspective; the [Radio & RF]({{< relref "/docs/radio-rf" >}}) section covers them in their natural habitat of antenna systems and receivers.

## What This Section Covers

- **[Amplitude & Frequency Modulation]({{< relref "amplitude-and-frequency-modulation" >}})** — Why modulation exists; AM sidebands and bandwidth; FM deviation and Carson's rule; non-RF applications.
- **[Pulse-Based Encoding]({{< relref "pulse-based-encoding" >}})** — PWM, PDM, and their connection to Class-D amplifiers and delta-sigma conversion.
- **[Digital Modulation & Data Encoding]({{< relref "digital-modulation-and-data-encoding" >}})** — Line codes, audio interface protocols (I2S, S/PDIF), and signal integrity on digital audio links.
