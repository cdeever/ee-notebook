# Audio & Signal Processing

Analog and digital audio, filter design, FFT, DACs and ADCs, sampling theory, modulation techniques, and DSP fundamentals. This section covers what happens when electronics meets waveforms — from microphone preamps to digital signal chains.

Entries bridge the analog and digital worlds, exploring how signals get captured, transformed, and reproduced.
