# Filters & Frequency Behavior

Shaping signals in time and frequency. Every analog circuit has a frequency response — intentional or not. Filters make that response deliberate: passing some frequencies, rejecting others, and defining the bandwidth of a signal path.

Understanding frequency behavior also means understanding what happens outside the passband — the roll-off, the phase shift, and the unintended resonances that turn a clean design into an oscillator.

## What This Section Covers

- **[RC & RL Filters]({{< relref "rc-and-rl-filters" >}})** — Low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass intuition with passive components.
- **[Active Filters]({{< relref "active-filters" >}})** — Op-amp-based filter designs, stability, and component sensitivity.
- **[Frequency Response]({{< relref "frequency-response" >}})** — Gain vs. frequency, phase, roll-off, Bode plots, and unintended behavior.
