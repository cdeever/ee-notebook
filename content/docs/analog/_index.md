# Analog Electronics

Transistors, op-amps, amplifiers, filters, diodes, voltage regulators, and analog design techniques. This volume covers the continuous-signal side of electronics — the domain where everything is a tradeoff between gain, bandwidth, noise, and stability.

Entries range from single-component behavior to full circuit topologies, with an emphasis on intuition and practical design over pure theory.
