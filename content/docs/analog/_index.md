# Analog Electronics

Human-engineered behavior built on continuous signals — designing with the grain of physics rather than against it. Transistors, op-amps, amplifiers, filters, diodes, voltage regulators, and analog design techniques. This is the domain where everything is a tradeoff between gain, bandwidth, noise, and stability.

Entries range from single-component behavior to full circuit topologies, with an emphasis on intuition and practical design over pure theory. The [Fundamentals]({{< relref "/docs/fundamentals" >}}) section covers the underlying constraints; this section covers what you build on top of them.
