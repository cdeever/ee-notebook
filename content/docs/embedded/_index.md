# Microcontrollers & Embedded Systems

MCU architecture, peripherals, firmware patterns, toolchains, RTOS concepts, and bare-metal programming. This volume sits at the boundary between hardware and software — where registers, interrupts, and timing constraints define what's possible.

Entries cover specific microcontroller families, peripheral configuration, debugging firmware, and the patterns that make embedded code reliable and maintainable.
