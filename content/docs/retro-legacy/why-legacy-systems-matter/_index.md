# Why Legacy Systems Matter

Legacy systems aren't a niche hobby problem. Industrial controllers, medical equipment, broadcast infrastructure, military hardware, and building automation systems routinely run electronics designed decades ago. These systems stay in service because they're paid for, they're proven, and the cost of replacing them — including requalification, retraining, and downtime — dwarfs the cost of maintenance. The engineer who can read an undocumented board, trace a failed signal path, and find a substitute for a discontinued part has a skill set that doesn't go out of date.

There's also a learning dimension. Older designs expose the underlying physics more directly than modern integrated solutions do. When the whole amplifier is discrete transistors and passives on a single-sided PCB, you can see every design decision — biasing, feedback, thermal management — laid out in front of you. That visibility builds intuition that transfers directly to understanding what's happening inside the ICs that replaced those circuits.
