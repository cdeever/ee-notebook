# Radio & RF

Antenna basics, impedance matching, RF layout considerations, software-defined radio, transmission lines, and propagation. This is where wavelength starts to matter and PCB traces become components.

Entries explore the practical side of radio-frequency work — the techniques, tools, and hard-won lessons from working at frequencies where intuition from low-frequency circuits breaks down.
