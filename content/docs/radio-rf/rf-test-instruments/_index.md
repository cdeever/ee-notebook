# RF Test Instruments

The instruments that make invisible signals visible.

RF measurement requires specialized equipment because the act of measuring can disturb the circuit. Probing a node at 1 GHz is not like probing one at 1 kHz — the probe itself becomes part of the RF network, and the measurement technique must account for this. The instruments in this section are designed for frequency-domain analysis, S-parameter measurement, and power detection at frequencies where general-purpose bench equipment falls short.

## Instrument Pages

- **[Spectrum Analyzers]({{< relref "spectrum-analyzers" >}})** — Understanding frequency-domain measurement: swept-tuned and FFT-based analyzers, key specs (RBW, dynamic range, phase noise), and what to look for on the display.

- **[Vector Network Analyzers]({{< relref "vector-network-analyzers" >}})** — Measuring magnitude and phase with S-parameters, calibration procedures, and practical uses including the NanoVNA.

- **[Using Oscilloscopes at RF]({{< relref "using-oscilloscopes-at-rf" >}})** — Where time-domain instruments help at RF frequencies, and where they fall short.

- **[Directional Couplers & Power Meters]({{< relref "directional-couplers-and-power-meters" >}})** — Sampling forward and reverse power, measuring RF power levels, and understanding coupling and directivity.
