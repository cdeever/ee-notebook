# Measurement & Test

Organized by what you're trying to measure, not by which instrument you pick up. Each subsection starts with a measurement situation — safety, probing, power rails, signals, noise — and works through the practical questions you face at the bench.

Subsections are ordered prerequisites-first: safety and probing technique before anything else, simple checks (continuity, components) before complex ones (signals, spectrum, protocols), and cross-cutting skills (noise, calibration) at the end.
