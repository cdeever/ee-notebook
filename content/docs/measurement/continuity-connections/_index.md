# Continuity & Connections

Is this connected to that? Opens, shorts, solder joints, cables, traces. The simplest measurements, but often the first ones that matter when something doesn't work.

## What This Section Covers

Measurement intent — the questions you're trying to answer at the bench:

- **Is this joint making contact?** — Solder joints, crimp connections, header pins, socket contacts. Continuity beep vs. resistance measurement for marginal joints.
- **Is there a short between these nets?** — Board faults, solder bridges, damaged traces. Using resistance and diode mode to find shorts, and techniques for narrowing down location.
- **Which pin maps to which wire?** — Cable tracing, connector pinouts, and verifying wiring against a schematic. Especially useful for unfamiliar harnesses or hand-wired assemblies.
- **Is this connection intermittent?** — Cracked solder joints, fractured traces, loose connectors. Techniques for catching faults that only appear under vibration, flex, or thermal stress.
