# Calibration & Measurement Confidence

Trusting your readings. Accuracy, resolution, systematic error, uncertainty. This section comes last because it applies to everything above — every measurement has limits, and knowing those limits is what separates data from guessing.

## What This Section Covers

Measurement intent — the questions you're trying to answer at the bench:

- **Is my instrument accurate enough for this?** — Matching instrument specs to measurement needs. When a 3½-digit DMM is fine and when you need 5½ digits. When scope sample rate matters and when it doesn't.
- **Could this be a measurement artifact?** — Questioning the reading before trusting it. Probe artifacts, aliasing, ground bounce, capacitive coupling from your hand — all the ways a measurement can lie.
- **When was this last calibrated / compensated?** — Probe compensation, scope self-cal, DMM calibration status. The things you should check periodically and the things you should check every session.
- **What's the actual uncertainty?** — Understanding measurement uncertainty beyond just "accuracy." Resolution, repeatability, environmental effects, and knowing how many digits of your reading are real.
