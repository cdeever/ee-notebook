# Probing & Measurement Technique

Connecting to a circuit without changing what you're measuring. Probe selection, ground leads, bandwidth, loading — the stuff that separates a real reading from an artifact.

## What This Section Covers

Measurement intent — the questions you're trying to answer at the bench:

- **Am I loading the circuit?** — Probe impedance vs. source impedance. When your 10 MΩ DMM or 10x scope probe is still too heavy. High-Z nodes, current sense resistors, and knowing when you've changed the circuit by measuring it.
- **Is my probe bandwidth sufficient?** — Matching probe bandwidth to signal bandwidth. A 20 MHz probe on a 50 MHz signal doesn't just attenuate — it lies about edge shape.
- **Is my ground connection adding artifacts?** — Ground lead inductance, ringing from long ground clips, and why the spring-tip ground is your friend for anything fast.
- **Which probe type for this situation?** — Passive vs. active, 1x vs. 10x, current probes, differential probes, near-field probes. Choosing the right tool before you start measuring.
