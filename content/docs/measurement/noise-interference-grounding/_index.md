# Noise, Interference & Grounding

Tracking down unwanted signals. EMI, ground loops, crosstalk, coupling. The measurements you make when the circuit "should work" but something invisible is ruining it.

## What This Section Covers

Measurement intent — the questions you're trying to answer at the bench:

- **Where is this noise coming from?** — Identifying noise sources: switching converters, digital clocks, motor drives, external interference. Near-field probing, spectrum analysis, and process of elimination.
- **Is there a ground loop?** — Hum, buzz, and ground-referenced interference. Identifying ground loops between instruments, between boards, or between a DUT and test equipment.
- **Is this conducted or radiated?** — Distinguishing coupling paths. Does the noise travel on wires or through the air? Shielding experiments, common-mode vs. differential-mode, and ferrite tests.
- **Does shielding / rerouting fix it?** — Empirical fixes and verification. Testing whether a shield, filter, rerouted trace, or grounding change actually solves the problem — and measuring the before/after difference.
