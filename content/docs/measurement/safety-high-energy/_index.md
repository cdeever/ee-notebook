# Safety & High Energy

Mains, high voltage, CAT ratings, isolation, and the habits that keep you alive. This comes first because no measurement matters if you get hurt taking it.

## What This Section Covers

Measurement intent — the questions you're trying to answer at the bench:

- **Can I touch/probe this safely?** — Assessing hazard before connecting anything. Is it de-energized? Are stored charges drained? What's the worst case?
- **What voltage/energy am I dealing with?** — Identifying the energy domain: low-voltage DC, mains AC, high-voltage DC (tube amps, CRTs, switchmode rails), stored energy in capacitors or inductors.
- **Do I need isolation or differential measurement?** — When a floating measurement will fool you or kill you. Isolation transformers, differential probes, and when ground-referenced instruments are dangerous.
- **Is my instrument rated for this?** — CAT ratings, voltage limits, probe ratings, and the difference between a meter that handles a fault and one that becomes shrapnel.
