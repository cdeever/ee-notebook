# Audio & Analog Circuits

Audio-specific and analog measurement: THD, SNR, frequency response, gain structure, sensor interfaces. Where the signal is the product, not just a means of communication.

## What This Section Covers

Measurement intent — the questions you're trying to answer at the bench:

- **What's the THD / noise floor?** — Distortion and noise measurements. Audio analyzers, FFT-based THD, and understanding what the numbers mean in practice.
- **Is the frequency response flat where it should be?** — Swept or stepped frequency response measurements. Filters, EQ stages, speaker crossovers, and amplifier bandwidth.
- **Is the gain structure correct through the signal chain?** — Level at each stage. Headroom, clipping points, and making sure no stage is running too hot or too cold.
- **Is this sensor outputting the expected voltage/current?** — Analog sensor interfaces: thermocouples, strain gauges, photodiodes, microphones. Verifying the transducer output before blaming the signal conditioning.
