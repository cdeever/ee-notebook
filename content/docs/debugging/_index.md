# Debugging, Failure & Repair

Troubleshooting methods, component failure modes, rework techniques, soldering practice, and post-mortems. This volume is about what happens when things don't work — and the systematic approaches that get them working again.

Entries capture debugging strategies, common failure patterns, repair procedures, and the lessons learned from circuits that fought back.
