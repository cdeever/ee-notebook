# Digital Electronics

Logic gates, flip-flops, timing analysis, bus protocols, FPGAs, state machines, and the hardware side of digital systems. This is where signals become discrete and design becomes about edges, setup times, and propagation delays.

Entries cover everything from basic combinational logic through complex sequential systems and the practical realities of making digital circuits work reliably.
