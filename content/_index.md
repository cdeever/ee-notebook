# EE Notebook

This is a working notebook for learning electronics and electrical engineering — a place to record concepts, experiments, procedures, gotchas, and patterns as I encounter them.

It's organized into eight sections that cover the territory from basic circuit fundamentals through analog and digital design, embedded systems, signal processing, RF, measurement technique, and debugging practice. Each section holds flat, evergreen entries that get revised and expanded over time rather than dated posts that grow stale.

The tone here is exploratory. This is what I'm learning, not what I'm teaching. Entries capture understanding as it develops — sometimes incomplete, sometimes wrong and later corrected, always honest about what I do and don't yet know.

Browse the sections in the sidebar to get started.
